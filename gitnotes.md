# Git Notes

These are my notes on Git.
initializes git repository. holds all files create for git project. need to be in the folder want to initialize.
```
git init
```
This is `inline code`
what is ``two`` three```three```

$$f(x)=x^2$$
LaTex works here too
* `git init`: initializes repository
* `git status`: tells us status of repository
* `git add`: adds files to be tracked
* `git commit`: dedicate myself to version
need to `git add` before `git commit` each time
